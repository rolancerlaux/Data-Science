# Absenteeism at Work project:

This code consists of an exploratory data analysis and the validation of Random Forest Classifier Model, using SMOTE for unbalanced data.

**Question to be answered:** Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the workers in the dataset have absence of work?  

## About the data and context:

The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.

Number of Instances: 740

Number of Attributes: 21

Missing Values: 0

## Reasons for absence:

ICD-10 Codes: https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en

- 1 Certain infectious and parasitic diseases
- 2 Neoplasms
- 3 Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism
- 4 Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases
- 5 Mental and behavioural disorders
- 6 Diseases of the nervous system
- 7 Diseases of the eye and adnexa
- 8 Diseases of the ear and mastoid process
- 9 Diseases of the circulatory system
- 10 Diseases of the respiratory system
- 11 Diseases of the digestive system
- 12 Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
- 13 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
- 14 Diseases of the genitourinary system
- 15 Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
- 16 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period
- 17 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities
- 18 Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified
- 19 Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes
- 20 External causes of morbidity and mortality
- 21 Factors influencing health status and contact with health services.

And 7 categories without ICD:

- 22 patient follow-up
- 23 medical consultation
- 24 blood donation
- 25 laboratory examination
- 26 unjustified absence
- 27 physiotherapy
- 28 dental consultation

## About the project:

This project works on many important points in data science, such as decision making, which features are important for the model?

Or teach us how to deal with unbalanced data.
