# Diabetes Prediction project:

This code consists of an exploratory data analysis and the validation of Random Forest Classifier Model, using SMOTE for unbalanced data.

**Question to be answered:** Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes?

## About the data:

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## About the project:

This project works on many important points in data science, such as decision making, which features are important for the model?

Or teach us how to deal with unbalanced data.

We have to decide between an acceptable recall score rather than just looking at the accuracy.

## How to use:

Download the attached files and run on jupyter notebook in your machine.
