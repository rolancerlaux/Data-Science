# Linear Regression Project:

This code consists of an exploratory data analysis and modeling using XG Boost Regressor.

**Question to be answered:** Is a multivariate linear regression able to explain the values for the Posture Index? 

## About the data:

This data was collected by me during my undergraduate thesis.

Motivation: Increased lower-limb internal rotation and low/high foot arch are postural characteristics associated to musculoskeletal conditions.

This dataset contains several measurements of the Rearfoot-Shank Joint Complex of 22 subjects.


## About the project:

Clinical measures for a comprehensive assessment of the posture of the rearfoot-shank joint complex.

Conclusion: Our model was able to accurately predict the values of the posture index. 

## How to use:

Download the attached files and run on jupyter notebook in your machine.
