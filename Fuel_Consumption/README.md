# Another Linear Regression Project:

This code consists of an exploratory data analysis and modeling using XG Boost Regressor.

**Question to be answered:** Is a multivariate linear regression able to explain the amount of CO2 emissions? 

## About the data:

This dataset contains several features about car motors and its characteristics and the correspondent CO2 emission.

## About the project:

 We explore the features and preparete the data for our regression model.
 
 Conclusion: Our model was able to accurately predict the values of the CO2 Emissions.

## How to use:

Download the attached files and run on jupyter notebook in your machine.
